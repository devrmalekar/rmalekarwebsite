my portfolio website (https://www.rmalekar.com.np) : React.js, ASP.NET &amp; C#, MySQL, JSON


This is the source code for my personal portfolio website: www.rmalekar.com.np. The website is built with the following technologies:

Frontend: React ===> RMFrontEnd solution

Backend: ASP.NET 8 with C# 12 (RESTful API) ==> RMBackend Solution

Database: MySQL 

Key Features:
The frontend fetches data from a JSON file stored in a Git repository.

The backend runs a background service every 15 days to update the JSON file, ensuring fresh content is served.

This project showcases my skills and portfolio, and is structured with a modern tech stack to provide a seamless user experience.
